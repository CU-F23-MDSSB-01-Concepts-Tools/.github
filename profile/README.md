## üëã Data Science Concepts/Tools 2023 @ Constructor University Master "Data Science for Society and Business"

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è This GitHub organization is the practice area for both modules. 

Most stuff in this organization is private, except for the **website with the syllabus**

https://cu-f23-mdssb-01-concepts-tools.github.io/Website/

The main purpose of this organization is to provide **personalized repositories** for you as a registered student.   
These repos are where you do homework üë©‚Äçüíª and your final project.    
Your repos are private and only you and the instructors can access them. Not even your fellow students can see them. 

### Organization and Help

The repository **Organization**
https://github.com/CU-F23-MDSSB-01-Concepts-Tools/Organization
is used to provide non-public information about the course, e.g. lists of student projects.

The repositories **discussions** features can be used as a safe space for practical help. Use it when you have problems to set up!
Maybe there is already a solution or some practical information there
